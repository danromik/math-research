**Software packages related to my mathematical research**

* **OrientedSwaps**. A companion package to the paper *[Staircase Young tableaux, sorting networks and last passage percolation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rsa.21055)* written jointly with Elia Bisi, Fabio Cunden and Shane Gibbons. Written in Mathematica.
* **MovingSofas**. A companion package to the paper *[Differential equations and exact solutions in the moving sofa problem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10586458.2016.1270858)*. Written in Mathematica.
* **SU3-ASYM**. A companion package to the paper *[On the number of n-dimensional representations of SU(3), the Witten zeta function, and the Bernoulli numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03776)*. Written in Mathematica.
* **FPL**. A Mathematica software package and slide presentation titled *The combinatorics of fully packed loops and Razumov-Stroganov conjectures*, which I presented on Aug. 8, 2014 at [MAA MathFest](https://maa.org/meetings/maa-mathfest). Related to my paper *[Connectivity patterns in loop percolation I: the rationality phenomenon and constant term identities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6341)*.
* **Alternating sign matrix enumeration packages**. The folder "refinedasm" contains the following packages:
  * **RefinedASM**. A companion package to the paper *[More refined enumerations of alternating sign matrices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2009.07.003)* written jointly with Ilse Fischer. Written in Mathematica.
  * **RefinedASM1234**. A companion package to the paper *[New enumeration formulas for alternating sign matrices and square ice partition functions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2012.11.006)* written jointly with Arvind Ayyer. Written in Maple.
  * **GammaDelta**. A companion package to the same paper with Arvind Ayyer. Written in Mathematica.
* **SofaBounds**. A C++ command line tool implementing the computer-assisted proof from my paper *[Improved upper bounds in the moving sofa problem](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2018.10.022)* written jointly with Yoav Kallus. The SofaBounds source code is located in [this separate github repository](https://github.com/ykallus/SofaBounds).
